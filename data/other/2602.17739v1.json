  "title": "GeneZip: Region-Aware Compression for Long Context DNA Modeling",
  "summary": "Genomic sequences span billions of base pairs (bp), posing a fundamental challenge for genome-scale foundation models. Existing approaches largely sidestep this barrier by either scaling relatively small models to long contexts or relying on heavy multi-GPU parallelism. Here we introduce GeneZip, a DNA compression model that leverages a key biological prior: genomic information is highly imbalanced. Coding regions comprise only a small fraction (about 2 percent) yet are information-dense, whereas most non-coding sequence is comparatively information-sparse. GeneZip couples HNet-style dynamic routing with a region-aware compression-ratio objective, enabling adaptive allocation of representation budget across genomic regions. As a result, GeneZip learns region-aware compression and achieves 137.6x compression with only 0.31 perplexity increase. On downstream long-context benchmarks, GeneZip achieves comparable or better performance on contact map prediction, expression quantitative trait loci prediction, and enhancer-target gene prediction. By reducing effective sequence length, GeneZip unlocks simultaneous scaling of context and capacity: compared to the prior state-of-the-art model JanusDNA, it enables training models 82.6x larger at 1M-bp context, supporting a 636M-parameter GeneZip model at 1M-bp context. All experiments in this paper can be trained on a single A100 80GB GPU.",
